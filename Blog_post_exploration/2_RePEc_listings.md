# WORK IN PROGRESS, FINISHED BY END OF THE WEEK

The NBER series is a great source of research in our profession, but it
isn’t the full picture of research in the field. It is, after all, a
listing of working papers which are by definition not yet publications –
though most do go on to be published, as I noted in the [last
post.](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shoganhennessy/Econ_text_data/blob/master/Blog_post_exploration/1_NBER_working_papers.html)

Forunately, [Research Papers in Economics (RePEc)’s
Ideas](https://ideas.repec.org/) provides a large listing of economics
research which I can use as a complement to the NBER listings.

> ‘’IDEAS is the largest bibliographic database dedicated to Economics
> and available freely on the Internet. Based on RePEc, it indexes over
> 3,000,000 items of research, including over 2,700,000 that can be
> downloaded in full text.’’

To be specific, RePEc lists information on 57532 economists and 425459
published articles papers – considering only those in English as of 31
December 2019.

### Published Articles

425459 is a huge number of articles to consider, and as far as I can
gather, it is the largest set yet analysed – Hamermesh
([2007](https://www.nber.org/papers/w6761),
[2012](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18635)) consider only subsamples for
example. Lucky for us, computing power and open access to information on
published research have advanced enough to allow analyse of a more
complete set of the data.

So who are the most problific authors, by article count?
