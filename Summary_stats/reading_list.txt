Look in to NSF funding.  The econ dept of the NSF 
reduced funding in 1981, and hasn't really recovered.
Importantly, exogenous drop in funding here.
^The time period also coincides with authors who 
would go on to working papers 1970-2019.

AUthors who enter PhD in 1981, 1982 are exoegnously less
likely to funded by NSF grants than 1979, 1980 -- tease out with data.
