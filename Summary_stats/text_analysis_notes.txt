Idea of getting abstracts for published econ articles:
First go through every ideas.respec url and take eveyr abstract

Then get more creative with the abstract collection ->
Use Hollis.
Run Selenium across the Hollis search box (slowly!)
OR: ECONLIT https://www.library.hbs.edu/dbroute/330/standard-EconLit
across the Hollis website, taking the abstract of each one.
1. clean published option
2. put in Hollis search box
3. click on first result
4. Take the abstract
