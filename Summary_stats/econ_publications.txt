Notes on NBER WP 18635
SIX DECADES OF TOP ECONOMICS PUBLISHING: WHO AND HOW? Daniel S. Hamermesh

->  artifically small size (chooses only the very top of econ papers 
    small number of years, presumably for collection limitations)
    "acquired by skimming each paper"
->  "The purpose is not to test the roles of possible causes underlying 
    the phenomena shown here, but to stimulate speculation and hopefully 
    to generate formal examinations of them."

Exclusive classifications by hand, can they be exclusively classified?

I have a measure of economists PhD place and year.
Is there a measure to get from this:
perhaps insitutions which pioneer some area while an economist
is doing a PhD there, then how does that affect the economist?
->  Do they go on to specialise more often in that area?
->  Are they just positively impacted in general?
