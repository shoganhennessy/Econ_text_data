# Econ Text data
This repository contains all the files to work with the publishing pipeline in economics.
Looking in to who gets published in economics, the role of working papers and the NBER in general.

### Work in progress.  Stage of progress:
Building fuller dataset of economics authors and publications.

3. NBER inclusion, what is it good for? (in progress, up later).
4. Forming a research question and economic causal graph (in progress, up later).

Note: I do not list the code to build the data used in this work -- for which most of this project's work is creating.
